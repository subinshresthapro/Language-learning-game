# Module 2: Game Engine & Prototype Documentation

This document provides comprehensive information about the implementation of Module 2 (Game Engine & Prototype) for the NepaliJets language learning game app.

## Overview

Module 2 builds upon the project setup and authentication system established in Module 1, implementing the core game mechanics, reward system, learning progress tracking, and a functional prototype with 30 Nepali words.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Game Mechanics

#### GameManager.js
- Central game state management component
- Handles game initialization, state updates, and coordination between game components
- Integrates with user profiles for data persistence
- Provides methods for updating scores, awarding stars, and managing game settings

#### LevelManager.js
- Manages level progression and difficulty scaling
- Implements a rocket/airplane themed progression system with 6 levels
- Handles level loading, completion criteria, and unlocking new levels
- Adjusts difficulty based on player performance

#### MatchingGame.js
- Implements vocabulary matching game mechanics
- Supports multiple game modes (word-to-picture, word-to-word, sound-to-word)
- Includes scoring system, time limits, and feedback mechanisms
- Designed with age-appropriate interactions for children 4-7 years old

### 2. Animation System

#### AnimationSystem.js
- Comprehensive animation framework for visual effects
- Implements sprite animations, motion effects, and transitions
- Provides specialized animations for flying objects (rockets/airplanes)
- Includes celebration animations for achievements and rewards

### 3. Reward System

#### RewardSystem.js
- Manages stars, badges, and collectible rocket/airplane parts
- Implements achievement tracking and unlocking criteria
- Handles inventory management for collectibles
- Integrates with game performance metrics

#### RewardFeedback.js
- Provides visual and audio feedback for achievements
- Implements animated celebrations for earned rewards
- Includes specialized animations for stars, badges, and collectibles
- Creates engaging feedback appropriate for the target age group

### 4. Learning Progress Tracking

#### LearningProgressTracker.js
- Tracks words/phrases learned, pronunciation accuracy, and learning time
- Implements mastery levels for vocabulary (introduced, practicing, mastered)
- Manages learning sessions and streak tracking
- Provides comprehensive learning statistics

#### LearningMetricsDisplay.js
- Visualizes learning progress with charts and statistics
- Displays vocabulary mastery, pronunciation accuracy, and time metrics
- Implements streak visualization and achievement records
- Presents data in a child-friendly format

### 5. Prototype Implementation

#### NepaliWordsData.js
- Dataset of 30 Nepali words with translations, pronunciations, and examples
- Covers multiple categories (greetings, colors, numbers, animals, family, verbs, objects)
- Includes difficulty levels and category tags
- Provides example sentences for context

#### GameScreen.js
- Main game screen that integrates all components
- Implements a complete learning cycle for Nepali words
- Connects game mechanics, rewards, and progress tracking
- Provides age-appropriate interface and interactions

#### LevelMapScreen.js
- Rocket/airplane themed progression map
- Visualizes level progression and unlocking
- Implements animated transitions between levels
- Displays learning progress and achievements

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
The application uses React Context API for state management, with separate contexts for:
- Game state (GameContext)
- Level progression (LevelContext)
- Animation system (AnimationContext)
- Reward system (RewardContext)
- Learning progress (LearningProgressContext)

### Data Persistence
- Game progress is stored in the user profile
- Integrates with Firebase Firestore (from Module 1)
- Supports offline play with synchronization when online

### Animation Framework
- Built on React Native's Animated API
- Implements custom animation types:
  - Sprite animations
  - Flying object animations
  - Celebration effects
  - Reward presentations

### Game Mechanics
- Vocabulary matching with multiple interaction modes
- Difficulty progression based on player performance
- Time-based challenges with scoring system
- Age-appropriate feedback and guidance

### Reward System
- Three-star rating system for level completion
- Badges for achievements and milestones
- Collectible rocket/airplane parts for customization
- Visual and audio feedback for motivation

### Learning Progress
- Tracks individual word mastery levels
- Monitors pronunciation accuracy
- Records learning time and session frequency
- Provides insights on learning patterns

## Integration with Module 1

Module 2 integrates with the existing authentication and navigation system from Module 1:
- Uses AuthContext for user authentication
- Stores game progress in user profiles
- Leverages existing navigation framework
- Maintains consistent UI/UX design

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for future modules:
- Voice recognition for pronunciation practice
- Multiplayer challenges and competitions
- Expanded vocabulary and grammar lessons
- Parent dashboard for monitoring progress
- Additional rocket/airplane customization options

## Testing

The components have been tested for:
- Functionality across different game scenarios
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Performance with animations and transitions
- Age-appropriate interactions for the target audience

## Conclusion

Module 2 successfully implements the core game mechanics, reward system, and learning progress tracking for the NepaliJets language learning app. The prototype demonstrates a complete learning cycle for 30 Nepali words with an engaging rocket/airplane themed progression system designed for children aged 4-7.
